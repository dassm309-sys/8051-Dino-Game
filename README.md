///***8051 Based Dino Game: Dual-Prototype Implementation

An interactive implementation of the classic "Dino Runner" game logic built using the AT89C51 (8051 Family) Microcontroller. This project showcases high-performance embedded systems design, demonstrating hardware interfacing across two distinct display technologies: a character-based 20x4 LCD and a pixel-based SSD1306 OLED.

///***🎯 Objectives

Implement complex game logic within the 128-byte RAM and 4KB Flash constraints of the 8051 architecture.

Demonstrate bidirectional I/O management and real-time display updates.

Provide a flicker-free gaming experience through optimized software drivers.

///***🛠️ System Architecture

The project is divided into two distinct hardware prototypes:

1. Character LCD System (Prototype 1)

Display: JHD204A 20x4 Alphanumeric LCD.

Interface: 4-bit Parallel Mode (to optimize GPIO usage).

Graphics: Utilizes CGRAM (Character Generator RAM) to render custom 5x8 pixel sprites for the Dino and Obstacles.

Control Pins: RS (P3.5), EN (P3.7), Data (P2.4-P2.7).

2. Graphical OLED System (Prototype 2)

Display: 0.96" SSD1306 OLED (128x64 pixels).

Interface: Software Bit-Banged I2C Protocol.

Graphics: Pixel-perfect 8x8 sprite rendering stored in CODE memory to save internal RAM.

Control Pins: SCL (P2.1), SDA (P2.2).

///***🎮 Game Features

Dual Game Modes: Supports Classic and High-Speed/Hardcore modes for varied difficulty.

Flicker-Free Logic: Instead of clearing the whole screen, the software only updates changed pixels/cells, maintaining high frame rates.

Audio Feedback: Real-time collision alerts via a 5V active piezo buzzer.

Adjustable Settings: User-adjustable brightness control and score tracking system.

///***💻 Software Implementation Guide

To make this project work at the software level, follow these steps:

1. Development Environment Setup

Software: Install Keil µVision 5 (C51 version).

Project Creation: * Create a new Project and select AT89C51 from the Legacy Device Database.

When prompted to copy "STARTUP.A51", select Yes.

Target Frequency: Set the target clock frequency to 12.0 MHz (or 11.0592 MHz if using UART) in the Project Options.

2. Handling the Driver Logic

LCD Timing: The 8051 is fast. You must use the provided delay_us(5) function for the Enable (EN) pulse. Standard delays often fail because they are too slow for the HD44780 controller.

I2C Bit-Banging (OLED): Since the 8051 has no native I2C, use the provided i2c_start, i2c_stop, and i2c_write functions to manually toggle the SDA and SCL pins.

Memory Management: Use the code keyword (e.g., unsigned char code dino8[]) to store sprite arrays in Flash memory. The 8051 has very limited RAM (128 bytes), so storing graphics in RAM will cause a stack overflow.

3. Compilation & HEX Generation

Right-click on the project name in Keil and go to Options for Target 'Target 1'.

Under the Output tab, check the box "Create HEX File".

Click Rebuild All Target Files. Ensure there are 0 Errors.

4. Flashing the Microcontroller

Use a programmer like USBASP (for AT89S52) or TL866II Plus (for AT89C51).

Load the .hex file generated by Keil into the programmer software (e.g., PROGISP or XGPRO).

Connect the IC and click Write/Program.
